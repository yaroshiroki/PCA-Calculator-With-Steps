# PCA-Calculator-With-Steps
This is a simple program which calculates the PCA of a matrix, showing each step of the process.
I was looking for a PCA calculator online but I couldn't find one which was clear and useful for my situation. This is some code I wrote to try help me in my exam.
The labels explain each step and the comments tell you exactly what you need to change however, if it's unclear, here is a step by step guide.
1. Change the matrix A to be filled with the values of your matrix.
2. Depending on whether you are using a sample or the whole population, either use df_cov or df_mat. df_cov = Population, df_mat = Sample.
3. Change the value of n_components based on the value of k which the question asks you for.

Feel free to download and use this code:)
